            Medical debt refers to individual debt due to health care costs and related expenses. It is different from other debts because it is almost never accumulated by choice, and can add up quickly and unexpectedly. It can stem from any medical expenses, ranging from regular checkups to emergency room visits, and varies depending on insurance coverage and personal medical needs.<a href="#s1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
          </p>
        
          <p>
            In the US, medical debt accounts for more than 50% of of all overdue debt that appears on credit reports. For 15 million people, medical debt is the only debt they have in collections in their credit report.<a href="#s2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>

        What caused David’s misfortune? The saga began years before, when David decided to pay the 2% penalty tax<a href="#s3"><sup>[3]</sup></a><a name="s3b"></a> instead of paying $180/month for the

          Bronze Plan coverage typically means that insurance companies pay for around 60% of covered health care expenses and the consumer pays for the rest. The Affordable Care Act [somehow link this to our ACA description below] requires insurance companies to offer Gold, Silver, and Platinum plans along with Bronze.<a href="#s4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Each offers a tradeoff between premiums and deductibles.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the Affordable Care Act was first implemented, users spent hours on healthcare.gov before being able to purchase their insurance. The server was overwhelmed by the massive influx of information<a href="#s5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> the user interface was poorly designed and confusing to navigate,<a href="#s6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> and the cost calculator sometimes provided inaccurate information about subsidies<a href="#s7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> The poor implementation may have caused some people, like David, to opt out of the plans in favor of the 2%* penalty tax<a href="#s3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the slow start, 9 out of 10 Americans now have insurance. Prior to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, only 8 out of 10 Americans were insured.<a href="#s8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>

      <div id="panel3">
        <p>
          An Electronic Health Record (EHR) contains the medical and treatment histories of patients and is designed to be inclusive of a broader view of a patient’s care. EHRs are built to share information with multiple health care providers and organizations, so they contain information from all clinicians involved in a patient’s care.<a href="#s12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> However, when EHRs became more widely implemented in 2004, the industry built hundreds of standalone systems to create and maintain EHRs.<a href="#s13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> Within each system data is shared, but there is little to no data flow between different systems.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Problems arise with the lack of interoperability between EHR systems. 40% of medical errors are directly related to information omissions and miscommunications. EHR systems do not share information with each other and they all present information in different ways, causing misread charts, forgotten results, and untimely information in life-threatening crises.<a href="#s14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Other hospitals hesitate to transfer data in fear of incurring liability for sharing private information.<a href="#s15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2009, President Obama signed the HITECH Act, which stipulated that health care providers would be incentivized for demonstrating meaningful use of EHRs until 2015. However, providers still struggle to meet even modest health information exchange requirements.<a href="#s16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>

        David’s clinical presentation indicated influenza. While listening to David’s heart during the exam, the ED doctor noticed unusual rhythms. Worried that the cardiac event could be related to David’s influenza, the doctor ordered an EKG. [<strong>Pathway</strong>: If the EHR had been available], the doctor would have noticed the arrhythmia had been diagnosed years earlier. David had completely forgotten about the previous diagnosis [<strong>Pathway</strong>: Patients have access to personal data: what if he had access to his EHR? would he have remembered?].
      </p><br><br>    

      <p id="p-slide">
        Unsurprisingly, the EKG showed an arrhythmia, so the doctor admitted David for observation. Within the hour, David was given a bed, hooked up to a slew of monitoring equipment, and was having a full blood panel done.

      <div id="panel4">
        <p>
          Hospital-acquired pneumonia is a lung infection that occurs during a hospital stay. Infections contracted at a hospital can be especially dangerous because of two reasons. First, patients are often already very sick and cannot fight off the germs. Second, the types of bacteria in hospitals are often more dangerous strains because they can be resistant to antibiotics.<a href="#s17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> Pneumonia is one of the most common hospital-acquired infections, after urinary tract infections and wound infections, and has a 33% mortality rate.<a href="#s18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> 
        </p>
        <p>
          440,000 patients die every year from preventable medical errors.<a href="#s19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> Medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the United States, following cancer and heart disease.<a href="#s20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> Studies show that up to 12% of people going to a hospital will have severe harm as a result.<a href="#s21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Medicare is now punishing hospitals with high rates of infections and other medical errors in an attempt to reduce medical errors and increase patient safety. Publicly funded hospitals have been penalized the most because they take care of sicker populations and deal with more complex cases.<a href="#s22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> 
        </p>
      </div>

      <p id="p-slide">
        It didn’t have to be that way. If David had insurance, he would probably have received a flu shot. More opportunities for self-care could have saved David time and money. If the two EHRs had talked to each other, David likely would not have been admitted for an arrhythmia, and wouldn’t have developed hospital-acquired pneumonia.

          The purpose of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (also known as ACA or Obamacare) is to “increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance and decrease the cost of health care.” Insurance companies are no longer allowed to deny people coverage and they can no longer revoke coverage when people get sick. People are no longer forced to pay extra for insurance because of pre-existing conditions.<a href="#s30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>

          To make insurance more accessible, the Affordable Care Act implemented Health Insurance Exchanges. The exchanges function as marketplaces for health insurance plans.<a href="#s31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> Americans can use their state’s marketplace to obtain coverage from competing private health care providers. People can now compare prices of qualified health plans to choose the best fit in terms of coverage, premiums, and deductibles.

        <p>
          The Affordable Care Act also implemented pay-for-performance incentives, which pays health care providers for outcomes instead of for services. While there have not been any adverse effects, the system has yet to show much evidence of success in improving patient outcomes.<a href="#s32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>
